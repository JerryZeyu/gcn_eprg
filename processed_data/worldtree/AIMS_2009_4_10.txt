Question	Directions Read the information about wind erosion then answer the question. Wind can cause erosion that changes the surface of the Earth. Wind erosion can have negative effects on the environment by removing soil and polluting the air during dust storms. Walter wanted to find out if faster wind speeds increased the amount of wind erosion. Which instrument should he use to measure wind speed?	question
