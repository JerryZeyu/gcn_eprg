Question	A plant gets the energy it needs from the Sun. The plant uses about ten percent of the energy to carry on its life functions. The plant transfers approximately another ten percent of the energy to the consumers in a food chain. What happens to most of the remaining energy?	question
Answer	It is released into the ecosystem as heat.	answer
