48	as an object moves faster , the kinetic energy of that object will increase	nongold
49	a source of something increases the amount of that something	nongold
50	as kinetic energy of an object increases , that object will travel faster	nongold
51	an event is a kind of action	nongold
52	when a force is applied to an object , that force is acting on that object	nongold
53	as the power of the force exerted on an object increases , the speed with which that object is moved will increase	nongold

60	movement is a kind of change	nongold
61	damage means harm	nongold
62	if one surface is moved against; moved over; moved down another surface then those surfaces are touching	nongold
63	An example of an object with kinetic energy is an object in motion	nongold
